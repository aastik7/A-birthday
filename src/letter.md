Hi AISHA AISHA - AISHA DAY! 🎉✨

Hiiii Once again I am here to remind you how beautifully you have shaped my life with your kind contributions 🦋, its your special day so I want you feel it in you as I do from here 💖.

If you did the trivia/quiz you may have realized already we’ve known each other for about 1,158 days (that’s roughly 3.17 years!) ⏳ so instead of me going in circles 🔄, lemme start from the checkpoint.

The day I met you, Aisha, my life took a turn for the better 🌟. I’ve had people/friends around me my whole life, but never did someone so consistently put in the effort to be around me and make me feel more special than ever 🥹—part of my confidence comes from your contributions in me, and I will never deny that.

We’ve spent more than 1,500+ hours on various platforms combined just talking to each other (Yes, I’ve done the math 🧮✨). Talking to you has always been effortless for me—not because it’s easy for me to express myself (as you’ve described me as a ‘private-person’ 🫣), but because the effortless part always came from you 🦋. You once told me you provide that nonjudgmental space for your friends, and I’ve never questioned that because I’ve always felt it with you. Whatever little I shared, you took it as a gift 🎁, without judging me for struggling to show my colors 🌈—and that led me to share more, and only with you.

Your contributions and efforts in my life are endless 💫. You included me in every little/small decision in your life, kept me in the loop 🔁, and the only time you weren’t there for a week was when you were severely ill and hospitalized 😷—but thankfully, you survived and came back to all of us who love and celebrate you 🎊.

You didn’t just make me part of your life—you’d worry about every little thing that could come between us sharing time ⏰. Like when you had tests 📚, you’d still do your best to be with me (even though you’d be breathing hard in frustration 😤). Or when you were in college and Thanatos and I would be talking, you’d still chime in every now and then—EVEN THO YOU’RE IN SCHOOL 🏫, before and mid-class?! 😭 Never have I had someone do that for me. Your effort always put the hardest smile on my face 😊💖.

Or that time in the UAE when you were getting your hair done 💇‍♀️, and you felt bad about not spending time with me, so you kept listening in on my and Thanatos’ convo—EVEN WHEN THE HAIRSTYLIST WAS LITERALLY IN YOUR HAIR 😂‼️ YOU are beyond adorable, Aisha—the brightest star in my life ⭐🦋.

Not one moment did you miss when you were in the UAE 🏙️. Food or no food, you’d grab that balcony spot and talk with me for hours 🌙, begrudging the moments you couldn’t. I still remember how happy you’d get—I could hear the breeze, traffic, cars 🚗, and you eating while telling me, “NERO, you wanna see what I GOT?” or “Do you know what happened with Noor?” 😆 Or that time you forgot expensive gifts and had to do plane-hijack-level negotiations ✈️😂 to get them back! And your first solo flight? I was lowkey concerned that day 🥺 (but you were so cute 🥰). Stop being this adorable or I WILL EAT YOUR CHEEKO! 👹🍎

You opened up to me about your weakest moments 🦋, even the ones that took you forever to share. You felt safe enough to be vulnerable with me, giving me the same trust as someone like Fahad (who’s been there since Day 1) 🤝. That made me feel so cherished 💞.

I’m not the smartest �, and definitely not the best in return. At times, you needed me more than I realized, and my naivety hurt you 😔. Even though it’s your birthday, I won’t sugarcoat it—you went through pain because of me, and I see that now in hindsight 🔍. Feeling even a quarter of what you felt hurts me 🥀. I’ve said this before, but it runs through my head every day 💭.

I won’t disappoint—I’ll do my best to understand emotions better 🧠❤️, especially for you, who holds the highest spot in my life 👑. You deserved the benefit of the doubt, but sometimes you got frustration instead of the help you needed 😣. I did try, but I wish I’d done more to guide you out of those dark moments 🕯️.

I didn’t wanna write all this—sorry again 😅💔 NOM NOM anyway, AISHA, I really really reallly like you 😖💘!!! I appreciate you walking into my life, filling everything with color 🎨. Every second I invested in you, I got back tenfold 💎.

You are THAT GIRL. I admire, respect, and look up to you in so many ways 👏🔥. I’ve talked about you 100s of times to others, using you as an example to teach and learn from 📚✨.

Where you are today—and where you’re going—is so bright ☀️. I, your friends, and your family are SO PROUD of you, AISHA!! 🎂🎈 A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the most beautiful soul I’ve shared my life with 🦋💕. I wish you nothing but happiness (from those you want it from) and every achievement you pray for 🙏✨.


Happy Birthday, BEAUTIFUL AMAZING GORGEOUS ADORABLE CUTE THE SWEETEST AISHA AISHA 🌟
